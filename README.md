Our group used everything we've learned over the past six weeks to create a front-end application to showcase to potential employers. We divided up tasks as equally as plausible between the four members to develop the website using the New York Times books api and the google books api. The website itself has the user select one of several current bestsellers lists from the New York Times bestsellers lists and displays the top 6 books in those catagories. There is an amazon link the user can click on to purchase the book, and a save button if the user would like to save the amazon link while they check different lists.
